# GCSS Website — Project Guide for Claude

## What this is
Demo website for **GCSS (Global Charger System Service)** — an EV charging management platform. This is a competitive demo; design polish matters because we're benchmarked against a skilled designer's site.

## Stack & layout
- Frontend lives in `website/frontend/` (Next.js, App Router, TypeScript).
- Pages are under `website/frontend/src/app/[locale]/` — locale-based routing for EN/ZH.
- Shared styles in `website/frontend/src/app/styles/`.
- Translation system: EN/ZH, driven by locale routing + translation objects.

## Pages
index, product, pricing, blog, contact, forum, docs, login, register, forgot-password.

## Deployment
After any changes, deploy to production server **47.242.75.250**. See `DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md` / `QUICK_DEPLOY.md` for the flow.

## Working agreements
- Focus on visual polish and completeness over new features.
- Keep EN/ZH translations in sync when editing copy.
- Prefer editing existing components/styles over creating new files.

## Session log
Claude should append a short bullet to the log below at the end of each working session so the next session can pick up cold.

### Log
- 2026-04-10: Removed "System Advantages" section (Section 6) from B2B page and its SubNav entry. Kept `advantages.payment*` translation keys since Section 5's Payment Flow card still uses them. Pushed to main (auto-deploy).
- 2026-04-11: Replaced 3D rotating globe on homepage Global Coverage section with interactive 2D Natural Earth world map. Kept same data (China origin + 17 coverage countries) and brown/gold palette. Added d3-zoom (drag to pan, scroll to zoom), hover tooltips, staggered arc draw-in animation from China, pulsing markers, and +/−/reset buttons. File: `website/frontend/src/components/sections/home/GlobeVisualization.tsx`. Pushed to main (auto-deploy).
- 2026-04-11 (later): Discovered GitHub Actions deploy was silently skipping rsync for an unknown length of time — `SSH_KEY`/`CI_HOST`/`CI_USER`/`CI_PATH` secrets are all unset, and the old workflow reported "success" anyway. Patched `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to `exit 1` when secrets are missing so future breakages surface immediately. Until the user adds the GitHub secrets, manual deploys go via `SFTP_PASSWORD='Gcss123.' npm run deploy` from `website/frontend/` (uses `scripts/deploy.js` → SFTP to `47.242.75.250:/var/www/gcss-website`). Also shipped three debugger-flagged fixes in commit c4d543b: (1) densified globe arcs with `d3.geoInterpolate(64)` to fix China → French Polynesia / Brazil drawing the wrong way, (2) moved the hard-coded English dashboard sentence in `docs/page.tsx` into `docs.dashboard.desc` EN/ZH keys, (3) converted two `<img>` tags (homepage + docs) to `next/image` at 1920×1080. Trusted-by operator list also swapped from global giants (ChargePoint, EVBox, BYD…) to smaller regional operators (Powerdot, Spirii, Atlante, Kople, Voltio, Statiq, Vourity, Etrel, ChargeUp, Plugzio). All deployed via SFTP.
- 2026-04-11 (changelog + payment request): Added **Changelog** section at the end of the homepage — glass-card timeline with 4 versioned entries (v2.4.0 → v2.1.0), version/date/tag chips, animated gold dot markers on a vertical spine, and a "View full release notes" CTA linking to `/blog`. Translations via `changelog.*` keys in both locales. Styles in `sections.css` (`.changelog-section` / `.changelog-timeline` / `.changelog-entry`). Also added a **local-payment request form** inside the Payment Partners section (`src/components/sections/home/PaymentRequestForm.tsx`, client component) — inputs for payment method, country/region, and email, with an inline submit-received confirmation. Translation keys under `payment.request.*`. Deployed via SFTP. Standing user instruction: always push all changes to the production server after any edit.
- 2026-04-11 (review cleanup): Frontend-wide cleanup from superpowers:code-reviewer report. **Globe**: mounted guards for fetch + tooltip setState, CDN fetch `.catch` → error-state UI, `svg.on('.zoom', null)` cleanup, removed no-op fill ternary. **DiagramModal**: rewrote as `DiagramModalProvider` React context (no more `window.openDiagramModal` global), added `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby`, Escape handler, focus-in/restore, localized title via new `models.modalTitle.b2c/b2b` keys. **b2b page**: `<a>` demo buttons → `<button type="button">`; replaced 9 unguarded `t.raw(...) as string[]` casts with a `rawList()` helper that `Array.isArray`-guards. Inlined demo creds as `DEMO_CREDS` const (removed from translation files). **Deleted dead code**: `lib/api.ts`, `lib/constants.ts`, `hooks/useMagneticEffect.ts`, `hooks/useIntersectionObserver.ts`, `lib/lazy-components.ts`, `components/sections/home/BusinessDiagram3D.{tsx,css}`. **Deps**: uninstalled 17 unused packages (next-themes, react-fast-marquee, react-intersection-observer, react-use-measure, canvas-confetti, embla-carousel-react/autoplay, lottie-react, class-variance-authority, tailwind-merge, clsx, tsparticles + 2 subpkgs, gsap, @gsap/react, framer-motion) → 64 transitive removed. **SEO metadata**: added to `product/page.tsx`; converted blog, contact, login, register, forum, faq, forgot-password, docs from `'use client'` pages into server `page.tsx` → `PageClient.tsx` splits, each with page-specific title/description. **Translations**: added `models.modalTitle.*`, `steps.stepLabel`, `b2b.advantages.paymentTitle`, `docs.copy/copied`; translated `b2b.profit.subtitle` in zh.json. Localized "Step 1/2/3" and "Copy/Copied!" hardcoded strings. Also removed duplicate `generateStaticParams` from `[locale]/page.tsx` (layout already has it). **Header nav a11y**: dropdown triggers are now `<button>` with `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`; CSS opens on `:focus-within` and `.open` in addition to `:hover`. **Hygiene**: added `.claude/` to root `.gitignore` and untracked `.claude/settings.local.json`. Build green, all 26 static pages generated. **Not yet deployed** — awaiting user go-ahead.
